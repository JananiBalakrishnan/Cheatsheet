What is Kubernetes?

- Open source system for managing containerized applications across multiple hosts.
- Open source container orchestration platform that automates many of the manual processes involved in deploying, managing, and scaling containerized applications.

What are kubernetes clusters?

You can cluster together groups of hosts running on Linux containers, and Kubernetes helps you easily and efficiently manage those clusters.

Points : 
* Kubernetes was originally developed and designed by engineers at Google.
* Red Hat was one of the first companies to work with Google on Kubernetes, even prior to launch, and has become the 2nd leading contributor to the Kubernetes upstream project. 
* Later Google donated the kubernetes project to Cloud Native Computing Foundation.

How to setup Kubernetes and connect to the cluster : 
* If your project has already setup the kubernetes cluster, just download the kubeconfig.yaml file
* In your local Mac, run this command to install : brew install k9s
Under your user directory create .kube directory.
Under .kube directory, create config file(In some cases, the file gets created by default as part of the installation) in the below format, and add the following properties : 
* apiVersion: v1
* clusters:
- cluster:
certificate-authority-data
server
name
* contexts:
- context:
    cluster: <>
    user: <>
  name: <>
  current-context: <>
kind: Config
preferences: {}
users:
- name: <>
  user:
    client-certificate-data:
    client-key-data:
    token:

AZURE KUBERNETES SERVICE : Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)/AZURE CLI
Step 1 : Authentication to AKS : 
az login

az aks get-credentials --resource-group {your-resource-group} --name {your-aks-name}

The section would look like : 
users:
  - name: clusterUser_{your-resource-group}_{your-aks-name}
    user:
      auth-provider:
        config:
          apiserver-id: ...
          client-id: ...
          config-mode: '1'
          environment: AzurePublicCloud
          tenant-id: ...
        name: azure

  

In order to view and manage the clusters in your local, you can add the kubeconfig.yaml configuration you have downloaded from your azure kubernetes service config yaml file. 

Kubernetes Command Line Tool To Manage Your Clusters in your local : 
https://k9scli.io/

Install k9s using brew command : brew install k9s
Add the configuration to .kube/config file

And you are set!

Launch k9s using this command :
k9s

K9s Commands : 
Press 'shift+Colon' - For Searching with any keyword
Type 'pods' - Gives the list of pods to choose from
secrets - Gives the cluster secrets, credentials
Press 'y' - Choose a secret and press y to display all the credentials as yaml file like below :
